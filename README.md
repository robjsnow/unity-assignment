# README.md for Unity 2D Top-Down Game Assignment

## Project Overview
This Unity assignment involves creating a simple yet engaging 2D top-down game using Unity and C#. The focus is on implementing various essential features in Unity/C#, providing a comprehensive learning experience. Key aspects of the project include game object manipulation, UI elements, basic character movement, and inventory management.

## Features

### Top-Down 2D Character Controller
- Implement a basic top-down 2D character controller.
- Ensure character can move in all directions with normalized movement.

### Inventory System
- Create an inventory system with three slots, similar to a simplified version of Minecraft's hotbar.
- The inventory updates dynamically as items are picked up or dropped.

### Item Interaction
- Implement a system for the player to pick up and drop items using designated inputs.
- When items are picked up, they are added to the inventory.
- Dropping an item spawns it back into the world in front of the player.

### Item Representation
- Items are represented as basic shapes.
- The player character is represented as a yellow square.

### Inventory Mechanics
- The inventory can hold a maximum of three items.
- When the inventory is full, the player cannot pick up any more items.
- A UI element (red circle) indicates when the inventory is full. This element disappears when there's space in the inventory.

### Weight and Player Speed
- Items have assigned weights.
- The player's movement speed decreases based on the total weight of items in the inventory.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience with:
- Creating and manipulating game objects and prefabs in Unity.
- Developing a simple 2D character controller.
- Implementing a basic inventory system.
- Utilizing Unity's UI system to provide gameplay feedback.
- Scripting in C# for game mechanics and player interactions.
